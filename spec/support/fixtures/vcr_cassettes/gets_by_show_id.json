Also seeking redemption, along with Eleanor, are Senegalese philosopher Chidi Anagonye, who is tortured by decision-making; elegant Pakistani-British socialite Tahani Al-Jamil, and dance-obsessed Floridian Jason Mendoza. Michael is aided by Janet, a human-esque repository for all of the knowledge in the universe. However, when Michael and Janet begin interfering with the humans' lives, to make sure they wind up in The Good Place, they're going against the Judge's orders and on borrowed time. When The Bad Place gets involved, Michael and Janet must ask themselves, just how far they'll go to keep the humans out of The Bad Place.\",\"poster_path\":\"/3dJDT1dVSuHBYqWD0OLT1ZXeLq7.jpg\",\"season_number\":3,\"vote_average\":7.7},{\"air_date\":\"2019-09-26\",\"episode_count\":13,\"id\":125516,\"name\":\"Season 4\",\"overview\":\"The experiment on self-improvement in the afterlife begins.

Once these deceptions have been uncovered, the four human test subjects are Chidi himself, Simone, gossip columnist John, and entitled chauvinist Brent. Eleanor and the rest of the team encourage the four to become friends, study ethics together, and improve as people. By the conclusion of the year-long experiment, all but Brent have shown moral improvement, and even Brent shows potential for change at the last minute.
